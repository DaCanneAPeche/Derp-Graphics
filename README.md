# Derp Graphics

Kinda a game engine but it sucks.
In making using vulkan and entt, not tested, no features, not safe.
Supports ImGui ig.

## Dependencies

You need the vulkan SDK installed in 1.3 (1.2 prob works), with `glslc` installed in order to compile the shaders. Deps libraries are automaticly installed using xmake (see below). 

## Build

Install [xmake](https://xmake.io/), a build tool that is very easy to configure using lua. Just type `xmake` to build the project (and install deps) and `xmake run` to run it.
